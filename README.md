# Map-Analyzer

Developed a Java-based project leveraging graph algorithms to optimize road network design. 
Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path and Kruskal’s algorithm to construct 
a minimally connected road map. The project analyzes travel efficiency and construction costs, 
comparing trade-offs to optimize road selection while minimizing resource usage.
